## What is Javascript?
I consider my learning process going through 4 stages so far. Javascript is a problematic language because it's friends are shady. Yeah, I'm talking to you, Browsers. I had no idea what Javascript did in comparison to what the DOM, or Browser did.

#### The parts;

##### The language
Javascript is a programming language that does what other languages do.

##### The browser
The broswer is designed to manage user interaction. Clicking the keyboard, scrolling down the page, or hovering over somethign with the mouse. The browser does those things. Those are called Events and Javascript is how we interact with these, user events.

##### The DOM
The Dom is the contract we have come to accept as what the page is created. This is how javascript and the browser have agreed to talk to each other. There are two different ways to talk about the DOM. The Dom is not HTML, but it's written in HTML. So things like <body>, <h1>, <p> are dom but that's not what makes them the contract. It's that they are nested and that we have parents, siblings, and children. That the dom is something of a heirarchy of elements so that when you use those terms, you have bearings.

#### Libraries
Honorable mentions include JQuery, AJAX, NODE, JSON, CoffeeScript, Underscore, Masonry, Angular, React, and Backbone.
