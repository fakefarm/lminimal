## Fake farm stage

There are still many little nuances of this language that are not logical, but more tribal knowledge. Because of that, I'm intentionally spending time building pet projects. I started fakefarm.com to give me a place to practice. Part of the reason you need to host it online is because AJAX doen't work locally (unless you're on a platform like Rails.)

#### Couple projects I'm building include;
- slideshow
- interactive buttons
- forms
- server manipulation


## Specifics to learn
- How functions are invoked
- The this property
- functional scope
- protecting yourself
