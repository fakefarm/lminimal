Came across a really cool way to combine CSS today.
I've known about psudo selectors like :hover, but didn't know about the others.
I've known about the very broad decendent flow, but not the speicific using "+", ">", or "~"
I've also known about display:none, and display:block.

Today I was introduced into using them together to work with some small nav related concepts that don't need jquery.
It's not so much that I want to avoid jquery. In fact, I'm looking for all kinds of ways to use it.

But, I think it's a comment of keeping things simple and using the tool as an expert.
