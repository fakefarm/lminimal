What a huge topic and something that evokes lots of hate and a little love. I for one can say it has been a hard language to learn. But there are so many frameworks and tools that provide a little distance from the ugliest parts. Things like node, jquery, angular, ajax, coffeescript. However, I believe it is up to us to learn the language first before leaning to heavily on the niceties.

Lord, thank You for getting me this far!
