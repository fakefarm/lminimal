### Why is my Javascript not working
Here, you learn about things in a more indepth fashion;
variable scope
functional scope
closures
objects
this
module pattern
timers
tests

All of the above terms created teh 'deer in headlights' thoughts for me. How am I ever going to learn this language with all these crazy concepts. While it's true you go through that, persistence, determination, reading, and practice helped me get through tis stage.

#### Resources that helped me get through this stage
- addy osman patterns
- chris coyer module
- javascript ninja
- javascript good parts
- lynda functions
