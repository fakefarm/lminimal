### Reasons to learn
Accounting is the language of business. Javascript is the language of the Browser. If you expect to interact with users, then you will need to know the language. On top of that, ask any experienced coder and he'll tell you that this language is not going anywhere anytime soon. So, it's worth learning it.

There are so many awesome technologies that are built on top of javascript, and this trend is growing. While it is true you can create concepts using these abstractions, you will put yourself at much ease if you have a competent understanding of the underlying nature of their language. I like to think that these libraries as speeding the process, not doing anything for me that I don't comprehend. However, I believe it is up to us to learn the language first before leaning to heavily on the niceties.
