# How does JS work?

I had to learn the workflow;

1. Setup the page
you really only need to know one method;
  window.onload.
2. Find the elements you're interested in
  document.getElementById
3. Attach an event handler to them
  myVar.onclick = function(){}
4. Do something once that event is triggered.
  openAccount();

Once I got that workflow in my view, then I felt I graduated to the next step;
